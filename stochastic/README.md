# Stochastic Process

A stochastic process is a mathematical model that describes the evolution of a system over time where outcomes are influenced by random variables. 
It provides a framework for understanding uncertain or random phenomena by capturing how the system's state changes probabilistically as time progresses. 
Examples: Brownian motion, stock price movements, gene expressions...

## Gaussian Process

A Gaussian process is a probabilistic model used in machine learning and statistics to characterize distributions over functions.
It defines a distribution over functions where any finite set of function values is jointly Gaussian. 
Gaussian processes are flexible tools for regression, classification, and uncertainty quantification, commonly used in fields such as geostatistics, computer vision, and Bayesian optimization.
